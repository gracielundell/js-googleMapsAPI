# js-googleMapsAPI
Javascript API practice using gulp and sass

###By Gracie Lundell

##Description
An address book app made using Google's Map API, designed to allow users to add items to their list of places they would like to go in a city. The user enters an address to see it on the map, as well as notes for later. The user can save this list to view later, and may update the post. Node Package Manager (npm)'s Gulp and Bower packages were used to set up the file configuration and build for this project.
